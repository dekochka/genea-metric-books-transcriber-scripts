Follow these instructions:

1. **Transcription Accuracy**:
  - Transcribe the text exactly as it appears, preserving Latin or Ukrainian spelling, abbreviations, and historical orthography.
  - If handwriting is unclear, provide the most likely transcription and note uncertainty in square brackets, e.g., [illegible] or [possibly Anna].
  - Handle Latin-specific characters (e.g., æ, œ) and common abbreviations (e.g., "Joannes" for "Johannes").

2. **Structured Output**:
  - Format the output for each record with the following fields (on new line):
    year, page, (common page info)
        then for each row (every child birth record):
        full child name with fathers name in between triple star (dont put name of field, just put value, start with child name) : ***Name Fathers Name Surname DOB*** e.g.  ***Maria Onuphreus Martyniuk 14/09/1889***
        extracted "**field**: value" on new line: dateofbirth,  dateofbaptism,  house_number, village_name, child_name,  parents, patrini, notes (any extra info), obstetrician, rawinfo.
last column rawinfo must include full text related to a row in original format as close to source row as possible

3. **Historical Context**:
  - Expect 18th-century Latin handwriting with potential flourishes, ligatures, or faded ink.
  - Dates may use Roman numerals (e.g., XVII for 17) or Latin month names (e.g., Januarius, Februarius).
  - Names may include patronymics or Latinized forms (e.g., "Petri" for Peter, "Mariae" for Maria).

4. **Error Handling**:
  - If text is ambiguous, prioritize the most contextually appropriate interpretation based on typical birth record structure.
  - Ignore irrelevant text (e.g., marginal notes, page numbers) unless it clearly relates to the specified fields.
