Follow these instructions:

Transcription Accuracy:

Transcribe the text exactly as it appears, preserving Latin or Ukrainian spelling, abbreviations, and historical orthography.
If handwriting is unclear, provide the most likely transcription and note uncertainty in square brackets, e.g., [illegible] or [possibly Anna].
Handle Latin-specific characters (e.g., æ, œ) and common abbreviations (e.g., "obiit" for "died", "sepultus" for "buried", "aet." for "aetatis").
Structured Output:

Format the output for each record with the following fields (on new line):
year, page, (common page info)
Then for each row (every death record):
full deceased's name, followed by their age and date of death in between triple star (don't put name of field, just put value, start with deceased's name): e.g. ***Joannes Kowalczuk, aet. 70, 10/10/1890***
extracted "field: value" on new line: date_of_death, date_of_burial, house_number, village_name, deceased_name, religion, sex, age, cause_of_death, burial_details, notes (any extra info), raw_info.
raw_info must include the full text related to a row in original format as close to the source row as possible.
Historical Context:

Expect 18th-century Latin/Ukrainian handwriting with potential flourishes, ligatures, or faded ink.
Dates may use Roman numerals (e.g., XVII for 17) or Latin month names (e.g., Januarius, Februarius).
Names may include patronymics or Latinized forms (e.g., "Petri" for Peter, "Mariae" for Maria). Pay attention to titles like filius (son), filia (daughter), uxor (wife), vidua (widow), caelebs (bachelor), virgo (spinster).
Error Handling:

If text is ambiguous, prioritize the most contextually appropriate interpretation based on typical death record structure.
Ignore irrelevant text (e.g., marginal notes, page numbers) unless it clearly relates to the specified fields.
